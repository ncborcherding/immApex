# immApex VERSION 1.3.4

## UNDERLYING CHANGES
* Rebuilt ```propertyEncoder()``` and ```onehotEncoder()``` to use C++ backend with encodeSequences.cpp
* Rebuilt ```buildNetwork()``` via C++ integration (fastEditEdges.cpp)
* Motif quantification in ```calculateMotif()``` use C++ (calculateMotif.cpp)
* Reduce overall dependencies on external packages
* Improved speed of ```generateSequences()```, ```mutateSequences()```, ```adjacencyMatrix()```, ```tokenizeSequences()```, ```geometricEncoder```
* Added group.by argument to ```getIR()```
* Defunct ```variationalSequences()``` 
* Removed keras3/tensorflow suggests/dependencies
* Removed baslisk environment, python no longer required
* Updated C++ backend to C++17
* robust checks before running `getIMGT()` for website functioning

## NEW FEATURES
* ```calculateEntropy()``` added to calculate the positional entropy along a biological sequence
* Added basic diversity metrics (exported) to support ```calculateEntropy()```
* ```calculateFrequency()``` added to calculate the positional frequency along a biological sequence
* ```calculateMotif()``` added to get motif quantification of sequences
* ```calculateGeneUsage()``` added for single/paired gene enumeration

## BUGS
* Fixed NT position issue with ```inferCDR()```
* Fixed ```generateSequence()``` range issue for single-length sequences
* Fixed binary frequency issue in ```positionalEncoder()```
* Fixed ```buildNetwork()``` for relative thresholding returns relative value
