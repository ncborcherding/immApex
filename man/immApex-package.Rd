\title{immApex: Tools for Adaptive Immune Receptor Sequence-Based Machine and Deep Learning}
\description{
A set of tools to for machine and deep learning in R from amino acid and nucleotide sequences focusing on adaptive immune receptors. The package includes pre-processing of sequences, unifying gene nomenclature usage, encoding sequences, and combining models. This package will serve as the basis of future immune receptor sequence functions/packages/models compatible with the scRepertoire ecosystem.
